# Chess-AI
An Implementation of Chess that I wrote for artificial intelligence class.
This code was designed for a class-wide matchmaking framework. I had access to game information such as my player color, FEN String, and time remaining. I have designed the data structures that represent board states and simulate moves.

The algorithm was implemented in parts, and each feature is on its own branch.
1.) Implment legal move simulation and random move choice 
2.) Iterative Deepening Depth-Limited MiniMax
3.) Time Limited Iterative Deepening Depth-Limited MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning
4.) Part 3, with Quiscence Search and a History Table
